# jsyms

A Java-based systems simulation SDK. What does it mean? It means it provides the basic framework to simulate computer systems - concurrent, distributed, etc - executing over time. It's a slimmed down version of the same framework I've built and used as part of my PhD work - where I used it to simulate the convergence properties of a class of decentralized systems.
